# HoloDiffusion_Seminar_Presentation
A presentation I did for the seminar "Computer Vision Seminar: 3D Representation and Generation" at the Hebrew University.
The presentation includes a comprehensive summary of the paper "HoloDiffusion: Training a 3D Diffusion Model using 2D Images" by Animesh Karnewar, Andrea Vedaldi, David Novotny, and Niloy Mitra.
and an introduction to diffusion models.
